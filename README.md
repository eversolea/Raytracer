A raytracer built from scratch in c++ using the OpenCV and Eigen libraries. Featuring refraction, reflection, and shadow rays, as well as point lights, spot lights, polygonal meshes, adaptive supersampling, and the bounding volume heirarchy acceleration technique.

Images from each step of building the raytracer: https://www.cs.drexel.edu/~ae588/index.html

# Setup for OpenCV and Eigen
Include Opencv build folder in the Include Directories and Opencv build/x64/vc15/lib folder in the library directories. The following link may help: https://learnopencv.com/code-opencv-in-visual-studio/#Step-4
Also include Eigen in the Additional Include Directories
